A description of the dataset and its creation was published as Andreas Wimmer & Brian Min (2009) The Location and Purpose of Wars Around the World: A New Global Dataset, 1816–2001, International Interactions, 35:4, 390-417, DOI: 10.1080/03050620903328837

There is no other documentation with this dataset and those interested should refer to the above article, which is not public domain.

The data were originally found as an .xls file. This has been converted to .xlsx and two .csv files (one for each sheet within the xlsx file) for preservation purposes. Some cells may require editing or deletion for use in statistical software packages.

The following documentation is extracted from the .xlsx file and is presented here as additional documentation:

Appendix B - The Two World Wars

Given the unique complexity of the two World Wars, we coded these conflicts separately from our main dataset.
For each territorial location of conflict, we identified the war aims (subtype) and time span of the conflict.

"Years of conflict in territory" is split into 5 columns, each indicating one year of World War I. An "x" indicates the war was fought within the location indicated in that year; if no conflict within that location the cell is blank.
